# ROS-2-SLAM-and-Autonomous-Navigation-with-TurtleBot3

# Overview

This project demonstrates how to use ROS 2 with TurtleBot3 to achieve autonomous navigation in a simulated environment. It includes 2D mapping using the SLAM Toolbox and navigation using the Nav2 Stack, with visualization and interaction through Rviz2.

# Features

2D Mapping: Created a 2D map of the environment using the Cartographer node from the SLAM Toolbox.
Autonomous Navigation: Implemented both single-point and multi-pose navigation tasks.
Visualization: Used Rviz2 to monitor mapping and navigation progress, as well as to send navigation goals.
Simulation Environment: Entirely run in the Gazebo simulator, leveraging the TurtleBot3 robot model.
