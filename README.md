# ROS-2-SLAM-and-Autonomous-Navigation-with-TurtleBot3

# Overview

This project demonstrates autonomous navigation in a simulated environment using ROS 2 and TurtleBot3. It integrates SLAM Toolbox for mapping, Nav2 Stack for navigation, and Rviz2 for real-time visualization and interaction.

# Features

*2D Mapping: Created a 2D map using the Cartographer node from the SLAM Toolbox.
*Autonomous Navigation: Executed single-point and multi-pose navigation tasks.
Visualization: Monitored and interacted with the robot via Rviz2.
Simulation: Entirely simulated in the Gazebo environment using the TurtleBot3 robot model.
